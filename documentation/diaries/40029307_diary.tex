\section{Iteration 1: Coder}
As a coder, I had to develop the core of the application and then focus on my use case.

I missed the lab on Wednesday.
I missed the lecture and the tutorial on Thursday.

\section{Iteration 2: Organiser}
As an organiser, I made sure that the tasks were on time.
I also took care of setting up meetings. I also helped the documenters and the coders when needed.

\subsection{Week 6}
Week 6 was a transition week.
We transitioned into our new roles by presenting the code to the new coders and documenters doing the same thing with their documents for the new documenters.

\subsubsection{Team Meeting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coders from iteration 1 explain the code to the new coders for iteration 2 (and to others if interested)
    \item Documenters from iteration 1 show the documents created in iteration 1
    \item Coders separate the use cases and other tasks to be coded
    \item Documenters separate the content to be written (Architectural and detailed design specification)
    \item Discuss what worked well and less well in the first iteration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tasks performed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prepare the meeting for week 6
    \item Distribute the tasks between everyone and note them in Github
\end{itemize}
