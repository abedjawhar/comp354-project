\item Added a mocking library to the project, changes to the SQL tables of the business entities and java models. Added custom exception classes and modified services and DAO-s accordingly. Added tests and implementation for a DAO class. 

\item Removed business entitiy validations from the DAO layer and added them to the service layer. Updated SQL schemas and test database. Updated UserSercvice interface methods, added test cases for User DAO and UserService.

\item Meeting with Anne, documentation and code consistency discussion, assisted with non-functional requirements' description.

\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Week 5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Changes to the java models making the foreign collections eager instead of lazy, modified brittle service tests to work with in memory database DAO-s instead of mocking them.
