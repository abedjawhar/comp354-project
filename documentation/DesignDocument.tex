\section{Introduction and Purpose}

The goal of this document is to define the design for the desktop application myMoney. The majority of the design decisions have been taken     with the Requirements document in mind, one may thus want to look at this document first to have a clear picture of the problem in mind as well as the requirements demanded for the solution. This document presents an implementation of a possible solution to answer this problem. Its design is outlined through an Architectural Design (AD), a Detailed design (DD) and Dynamic Design Scenarios (DDS) for the application. The AD focuses on high-level project decomposition, the DD describes the overarching system design (which includes the UML design, divided into multiple subsections), and the DDS displays how the subsystems interact with one another in order to produce system-level services. This document may thus be used to plan, coordinate, and guide the development of the software, estimate and allocate necessary resources for proper execution, and  then actually implement the software for the system. It seeks, above all, to serve as a precise and stable reference throughout development.

Check section \ref{glossary} for a glossary of terms and abbreviation.

\section{Scope}

This document contains everything to do with the development decisions and design of the system, all of which are derived from the requirements, which are not described in this document. Also not included in here is any testing of the system, which verifies that the requirements are met. It is merely a blueprint for a system that should, in theory, successfully pass any tests that would be done in correspondence with the requirements.

\section{Architectural Design} \label{sec:arch}

The myMoney application uses the MVC architectural pattern. MVC imposes a clear separation of concerns, and thus emphasises a high degree cohesion and low coupling. It is traditionally used for user interface applications, offers easy adaptability and maintainability, and a natural rigidity in module structure. All of these advantages made MVC a fitting choice for our architecture.
 
 %To further  low coupling, using interfaces for each component will allow us to separate the implementation from the interface of the module, which eases parallel addition, modification, or testing of the system. This allows for a relatively large part of our team (upwards to 6 people, or half our team) to be working simultaneously on the application without fear of huge conflicts as people work on their sections.  See \ref{subsystem interface} to see how the interfaces are injected.

%The former passes it to the controls, which then makes requests for information to the "remote" database through the use of the services handling remote communication. From the DAOs, these services receive a serialisation of the "remote" account, which then translates the latter into usable data for the local database. Once this has been successfully executed, the model triggers a view update, wherein the user can see his newly requested additions. All other events triggered by the user have no need of the remote database, and simply employ a series of communications between the controllers and the services handling local database. The only time where the second database is being accessed is when the user first adds a bank account. In this case, our view receives the user's input. 

\subsection{Architectural Diagram}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{package-diagram.png}
\end{figure}

The \textit{view}, our graphical user interface, is implemented through the JAVAFX front-end framework. It consists of table views, menus, labels and other GUI components, which are then populated by the view controllers with data from the model. The view is the only component that the user interacts with. It reports any user-triggered events (mouse clicks, text entries...) to the view controllers, and renders the updated model received from the controller. A more in-depth view of the interaction between the user and the view can be seen in the dynamic models, in section \ref{Dynamic Models}.

The \textit{controllers}. The controller populates the views with the model and translates user input into service calls to manipulate the model. When the model is changed, it repopulates the views with new data. 

The \textit{model} is consists of two parts: the application logic, and the data. The application logic is organised in a layered structure of services, which each manage a different section of the system (session management, accounts, users, etc).
Each service performs validation related to its system domain on its inputs, and then delegates the calls to the services of the layer below. The Database Access Objects (DAO) lie  at the bottom of the hierarchy and directly communicate with the database. For examples in the controllers, their services, their intercommunication, and their validation, see section \ref{subsystem interface}.
The data is stored in an SQLite database. Our system actually employs two databases; The first, a local database, and the second, a "remote" database (also local, but acts as if it were remote) used to simulate the bank servers. The data itself consists of model classes, (e.g. bank account, account transaction, user account), which corresponds to the domain model of our application. See section \ref{subsystem interface} for more details on these services and the databases.


\subsection{Subsystem Interface Specifications} \label{subsystem interface}

%VIEW -----------
\subsubsection*{View Subsystem}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{view_subsystem.png}
\end{figure}
Our resources/fxml folder contains the view subsystem. The view is implemented, as mentioned before, through the JavaFX framework. It is a collection of FXML files, containing a structure contained in an AnchorPane. If the view model is simple menu (Login.fxml, SignUp.fxml, UpdateUserAccount.fxml), it will merely contain a few labeled text fields and buttons with 'onAction' parameters tying the buttons to a function in the view controllers. If it is a table view, (AccountDetails.fxml, AccountList.fxml, AllTransactions.fxml), then a TableView will be used with labelled columns, which are then recognised by the controllers in order to populate them with the model data. As nothing in our view contains actual code,  no functions are mentioned here. 

\subsubsection*{Controller Subsystem}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{controller_subsystem.png}
\end{figure}
The com.github.comp354project.viewController package contains a number of controllers for each different view. Each view is handled by its own controller, which contains each column and/or label as a private data member, and each button 'onAction' as a function. All controllers implement the Initializable interface, and hence contain an initialize(URL location, ResourceBundle resources) function which is called when the view is first displayed to the user. This function serves to populate the views with the domain data, if needed.  The controllers may receive user input from the view and catch user events such as button presses or table entry selections. The functions catching these inputs pass these calls to the services in the model, described below.   They are also the ones who pass any errors from the services to the views, mostly to be used for testing and alerting the user of any problems that might have occured.
 A more precise description of each controller is available in \ref{classes}
 
 \subsubsection*{Model Subsystem}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{model_subsystem.png}
\end{figure}
The com.github.comp354project.model package contains both our application logic and our database.  As mentioned in the previous section, it is organised in a layered manner, wherein each layer handles its own services and use the services of the layer below it within worrying about that layer's implementation. Data validation and processing is offered by each service: The account service, for example, validate calls to add or delete bank accounts, edit a transaction's category, or query for specific accounts. It does this by querying the database using an account DAO, and ensuring data integrity and validity (with regards to the business rules). It does not, however, worry about user authorisation, and simply assumes the layer above it (The user service) will have handled it. The com.github.comp354project.viewController calls services within this package to update the view and the model.

The com.github.comp354project.service package.account.remote package is a subsystem to our model which mocks an API call to remote servers of banks or credit card companies. In our case however, we don't actually have access to such systems. For this reason, the remote data exists in an SQLite database like our local one.

\section{Detailed Design} \label{sec:detail}

The myMoney system architecture is designed to be easily modified because of the low coupling between the modules. This was done with interfaces and auto injection of dependencies in classes. Each service package has a Module class designed to bind and provide an implementation to an interface. This way, classes are never instantiated directly into each other, but injected. This design pattern is useful because a change in implementation is as simple as creating a new class and change the module binding. The classes that use it and the tests should in no way be changed. Mocking classes for test purposes is also much easier.

As a side note, we noticed that merge conflicts using git were much less likely to happen because we can each work on different parts of the system without modifying another module.

The tool used for this purpose is Dagger version 2.

\subsection{Class Diagram}

In this section we provide the class diagram of our system, useful for the system developers and testers.This is an in depth look at all of the classes within our system see figure \ref{fig:class-diagram} below If a term is unclear, view section \ref{glossary} for the glossary.

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.8\linewidth}|}
\hline
Expression &  Definition \\
\hline
Object-Oriented Programming & A programming paradigm which separates entities into objects, and uses the concept of inheritance of properties, polymorphism of objects, encapsulation of objects. We use this paradigm for its maintainability and structural benefits.\\
\hline
MVC - Model-View-Controller Architecture & An architectural pattern which strictly separates components into the model (manages the data and logic), the view (output of the model), and the controller (handling input and passing it to the model or view).\\
\hline
Interface & A component of a system by which other entities (be it humans or other systems) may engage in an exchange of data with the system in question. \\
\hline
API - Application Programming Interface & A protocol or set of functions which serve as a method of communication to a software system. It is a type of interface, and the one by which our system will communicate with the banking institutions' databases. \\
\hline
DAO - Data access object & An object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism.\\
\hline
Dependency Injection (DI) & Software development technique where one object supplies the dependency of another object. \\
\hline
Module & Used in Dagger2 for the injection of dependencies into their classes and their submodules. Modules make the code less coupled. \\

\subsection{Subsystem X}

\subsubsection{Detailed Design Diagram}

UML class diagram depicting the internal structure of the subsystem,
accompanied by a paragraph of text describing the rationale of this design.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own




\subsubsection{Units Description}

List each class in this subsystem and write a short description of its purpose,
as well as notes or reminders useful for the programmers who will implement them.
List all attributes and functions of the class.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own

\section{Dynamic Design Scenarios} \label{Dynamic Models}

Describe some (at least two) important execution scenarios of the system using UML sequence diagrams.
These scenarios must demonstrate how the various subsystems and units are interacting to achieve a system-level service.
Units and subsystems depicted here must be compatible with the descriptions provided in
section \ref{sec:arch} and \ref{sec:detail}.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own


\subsection{Dynamic Models of System Interface}

We have chosen 3 major functionalities of the system (also known as use cases) in order to portray the interactions between the classes of the system. By using a sequence diagram, this will display the dynamics visually by showcasing the sequences of method calls when a particular use case begins functioning.
