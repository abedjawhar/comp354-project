\section{Introduction and Purpose}

The primary goal of this project is to develop the myMoney windows application. The goal of this design document is to provide all the details of the Architectural Design (AD), Detailed design (DD) and the Dynamic Design Scenarios (DDS) for the application.The AD section
focuses on the high-level project decomposition, the DD describes the overall system design including the UML design divided into subsections 
and the DDS will display how the subsystems interact with one another in order to produce system-level services

\section{Architectural Design} \label{sec:arch}

This section must give a high-level description of the system in terms of its modules
and their respective purpose and exact interfaces. 

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own

\subsection{Architectural Diagram}

A UML class diagram or package diagram depicting the high-level structure of the system,
accompanied by a one-paragraph text describing the rationale of this design.
It is mandatory that the system be divided into at least two subsystems,
and that the purpose of each of these subsystems be exposed here.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own

\subsection{Subsystem Interface Specifications}

Specification of the software interfaces between the subsystems,
i.e. specific messages (or function calls) that are exchanged by the subsystems.
These are also often called ``Module Interface Specifications''.
Description of the parameters to be passed into these function calls in order to have a service fulfilled,
including valid and invalid ranges of values.
Each subsystem interface must be presented in a separate subsection.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own


\section{Detailed Design} \label{sec:detail}

Complete description of the system design, describing one subsystem separately in respective subsection.
UML class diagrams are to be used, as well as a short textual description describing the purpose of each class.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own

\subsection{Class Diagram}

In this section we provide the class diagram of our system, useful for the system developers and testers.This is an in depth look at all of the classes within our system see figure \ref{fig:class-diagram} below If a term is unclear, view section \ref{glossary} for the glossary.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Glossary of Domain Concepts}
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.7}{
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.8\linewidth}|}
\hline
Expression &  Definition \\
\hline
User & The person that is using the application and the main provider of requests to the system. \\
\hline
User Account & A data object containing user information. It also contains the various bank accounts that a user may have linked to the system. \\
\hline
Bank Account & A data object containing transactions linked with a specific bank account in a bank institution. One user account may have more than one bank accounts.\\
\hline
Transaction & Any kind of money exchange associated with a bank account.\\
\hline
Transfer & A type of transaction that occurs between two parties.\\
\hline
Deposit & A type of transaction where the owner puts money in his own bank account.\\
\hline
Withdrawal & A type of transaction where the owner of the bank account removes money from his balance.\\
\hline
database & A local or online container which holds data in an organised, efficient manner. \\
\hline
server & a computer that is accessible on a network, on which a database and/or system may be hosted. The bank institutions' databases will be hosted on here. \\
\hline
Object-Oriented Programming & A programming paradigm which separates entities into objects, and uses the concept of inheritance of properties, polymorphism of objects, encapsulation of objects. We use this paradigm for its maintainability and structural benefits.\\
\hline
MVC - Model-View-Controller Architecture & An architectural pattern which strictly separates components into the model (manages the data and logic), the view (output of the model), and the controller (handling input and passing it to the model or view).\\
\hline
interface & A component of a system by which other entities (be it humans or other systems) may engage in an exchange of data with the system in question. \\
\hline
API - Application Programming Interface & A protocol or set of functions which serve as a method of communication to a software system. It is a type of interface, and the one by which our system will communicate with the banking institutions' databases. \\
\hline
DAO - Data access object & An object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism.\\

\subsection{Subsystem X}

\subsubsection{Detailed Design Diagram}

UML class diagram depicting the internal structure of the subsystem,
accompanied by a paragraph of text describing the rationale of this design.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own




\subsubsection{Units Description}

List each class in this subsystem and write a short description of its purpose,
as well as notes or reminders useful for the programmers who will implement them.
List all attributes and functions of the class.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own

\section{Dynamic Design Scenarios}

Describe some (at least two) important execution scenarios of the system using UML sequence diagrams.
These scenarios must demonstrate how the various subsystems and units are interacting to achieve a system-level service.
Units and subsystems depicted here must be compatible with the descriptions provided in
section \ref{sec:arch} and \ref{sec:detail}.

*Note: The above is a description of what to provide. Need to edit into our own


\subsection{Dynamic Models of System Interface}

We have chosen 3 major functionalities of the system (also known as use cases) in order to portray the interactions between the classes of the system. By using a sequence diagram, this will display the dynamics visually by showcasing the sequences of method calls when a particular use case begins functioning.
