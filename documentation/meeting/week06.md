# Week 06 Meeting
## Lab
* Coders from iteration 1 explain the code to the new coders for iteration 2 (and to others if interested)
* Documenters from iteration 1 show the documents created in iteration 1 (*Is this point useful??*)
* Coders separate the use cases and other tasks to be coded
* Documenters separate the content to be written (Architectural and detailed design specification)
* **Review** Discuss what worked well and less well in the first iteration
* Find a possible date for a :beer: during the midterm break? :smile:
