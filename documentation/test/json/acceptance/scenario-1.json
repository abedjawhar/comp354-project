  "description": "The initial setup when I launch the application for the first time.",
  "testCases": [
      {"expectation" : "As a new user, I expect that the system will have some sort of initial setup asking me for my personal information. I expect this to be fast and precise in its requirements, and short in its demands.",
        "reality" : "As a new user, I see first that the launching screen is giving me an option to log in or signup. I click signup as this is my first time running the application, and reach an account creation screen asking me to fill in 6 text boxes. I do, click Sign Up, and I am taken back to the login menu."},
      {"expectation" : "As a new user, after having performed the intial setup, I expect for the system to bring me to the main application screen.",
        "reality" : "After having created my account, I am taken back to the login menu. I log in with the credentials of the account I just created, and am taken to the account list table."}

    "Scenario Satisfied": "90\\%",
    "Comments": "It is difficult to know what the rules are for account creation before having broken them as they are only displayed if the information entered by the user to create a new account does not meet those requirements."
